# Next time I can

- keep the working solution for part one and have an assert statement to check the second solution continually
- when stuck, try to start the method from scratch, starting with comments and pseudocode
- leave out any early exits and optimizations until the end
- manually calculate the test cases provided by author to understand the problem better
- build new versions of algorithms step by step instead of copy pasting too much
  - When going from the backtrace to the roll_up, I was dealing with a for loop which had not place being there
