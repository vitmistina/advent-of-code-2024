# Next time I can

- Respect the data structure - when Eric mentions 3-bit numbers, go with that and represent numbers as octal

  - Translation from base 10 to other bases is not intutive for a human brain
  - Patterns will be more visible

- Continue using plots to visualize the data

  - But also plot the real input data, not just the tests

- Have pen and paper at hand - I would probably continue the reverse engineering path if I had these resources at hand
